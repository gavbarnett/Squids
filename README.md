## About Squids

In the demo you will see lots of dots, some static, some dynamic. 

The dynamic dots (white white outline at present) are the squids. These little creatures seek out food (the static dots), once they have built up their energy levels they can divide.

The static dots (black outline at present) are the food source. These grow over time and once at a given energy level spawn new life in the local area, you will see this as a pulsing action.
